#DAA Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort, also known as Exchange Sort, is a simple sorting algorithm. 
It works by repeatedly stepping throughout the list to be sorted, 
comparing two items at a time and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. 
The pass through the list is duplicated until no swaps are desired, which means the list is sorted.

How Bubble Sort Works

   1.The bubble sort starts with the very first index and makes it a       bubble element. 
    Then it compares the bubble element, which is currently our first index element, with the next element. 
    If the bubble element is greater and the second element is smaller, then both of them will swap.

   2.After swapping, the second element will become the bubble element. 
    Now we will compare the second element with the third as we did in the earlier step and swap them 
    if required. The same process is followed until the last element.

   3.We will follow the same process for the rest of the iterations. After each of the iteration, 
    we will notice that the largest element present in the unsorted array has reached the last index.
